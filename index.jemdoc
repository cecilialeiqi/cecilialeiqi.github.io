As of May 2020, I received Ph.D. from [https://www.oden.utexas.edu/ Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences], 
University of Texas at Austin. I was fortunate to be advised by [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/index.html Alexandros G. Dimakis] and [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/ Inderjit S. Dhillon]. 
I was also a member of [http://bigdata.ices.utexas.edu/ Center for Big Data Analytics] and [https://wncg.org/ Wireless Networking & Communications Group]. I'm currently visiting [https://www.ias.edu/ IAS] for the [http://www.math.ias.edu/theoretical_machine_learning Theoretical Machine Learning program] from September 2019 to July 2020. Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley for the program on Foundations of Deep Learning.

My research interests are *machine learning*, *deep learning* and *optimization*. Specifically, I'm interested in developing provably efficient and robust algorithms for some fundamental machine learning problems.
