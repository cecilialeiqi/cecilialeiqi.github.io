<h2> Vectorization of Line Drawing Image based on Junction Analysis</h2>
<h3> Abstract </h3> 
<p> 
Converting a scanned or shot line drawing image into a vector graph can facilitate further editing and
reuse, which is one of the hot research topics in computer animation and image processing. Besides avoiding
influence of image noises, its main challenge is to preserve the topological structures of the original line
drawings, such as line junctions, in the procedure of obtaining a smooth vector graph from a rough line drawing.
In this paper, we propose a vectorization method of line drawings based on junction analysis, which overcomes
the structure-preserving issue in existing methods. We first combine centerline tracing and contour tracing, which
allows us to detect the encounter of line junctions when tracing a single path. And then, a junction analysis
approach based on intensity polar mapping is proposed, to compute the number and orientations of junction
branches. Finally, we make use of bending degrees of contour paths to compute the smoothness between adjacent
branches, which allows us to obtain the topological structures in correspondence to the ones presented in the
input image. We have also introduced a refining mechanism based on quadratic surface fitting for path tracing,
which avoids accumulating errors of traditional path tracing and improves the robustness for vectorizing rough
line drawings. We demonstrate the validity of our method through comparisons with existing methods, and a
large amount of experiments on both professional and amateurish line drawing images.
